**A simple Hello World Blueprint for Tangle**

## üìö Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Forge](https://getfoundry.sh)
- [Tangle](https://github.com/tangle-network/tangle?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started-)

You will also need to install [cargo-tangle](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-tangle), our CLI tool for creating and
deploying Tangle Blueprints:

To install the Tangle CLI, run the following command:

> Supported on Linux, MacOS, and Windows (WSL2)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget/releases/download/cargo-tangle-v0.1.2/cargo-tangle-installer.sh | sh
```

Or, if you prefer to install the CLI from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tangle --force # to get the latest version.
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

Once `cargo-tangle` is installed, you can create a new project with the following command:

```sh
cargo tangle blueprint create --name <project-name>
```

and follow the instructions to create a new project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Once you have created a new project, you can run the following command to start the project:

```sh
cargo build
```

to build the project, and

```sh
cargo tangle blueprint deploy
```

to deploy the blueprint to the Tangle network.

## üìö Overview

This project is about creating a simple Hello World Blueprint for Tangle and EigenLayer.
Blueprints are specifications for <abbr title="Actively Validated Services">AVS</abbr>s on the Tangle Network. An AVS is
an off-chain service that runs arbitrary computations for a user-specified period of time.

Blueprints provide a useful abstraction, allowing developers to create reusable service infrastructures as if they were
smart contracts. This enables developers to monetize their work and align long-term incentives with the success of their
creations, benefiting proportionally to their Blueprint's usage.
